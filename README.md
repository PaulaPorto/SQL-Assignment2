a. No special Instructions needed.

b. I chose jackson JSON library because it is highly configurable,
widely used and trusted. I was in between using gson and jackson because they
both were the most commonly used and seemed to be the most trusted libraries online.
I ended up picking jackson due to good online reviews.
Jackson is an efficient java based library to serialize or map java objects to JSON and 
vice versa. It is downloaded 25 million times per month via Maven Central, and 16,000
projects depend on jackson-databind.
Itâ€™s the second most widely used Java library, after Guava.
Initially I was using jackson core for the assignment, but I 
eventually changed it to databind since the core was causing me some issues.
